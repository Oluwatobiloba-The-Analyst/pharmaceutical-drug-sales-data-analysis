## 🔍 Key Insights

- **High-volume, low-revenue mismatch:**  
  Some drugs like *Escitalopram, Senna, Oxycodone, Trazodone, Polyethylene Glycol, Simvastatin,* and *Enalapril* had high sales volumes but generated relatively low revenue. This suggests a possible price-volume imbalance, pointing to opportunities for **pricing review** and **margin optimization**. But it is important to note that the review should be done with consideration of the actual cost price of the drugs since high-volume sales don’t always translate to high revenue all the time.

- **Underperforming drug products:**  
Drugs like *dorzolamide* and *bupropion* performed poorly in both quantity and revenue, signaling possible *inefficiencies in product portfolio*, *tying up of inventory* and *potential effect on profitability*. This present an opportunity for *product re-evaluation*, *portfolio optimization* either through *promotional boosts* or *possible discontinuation*. 

- **Stable demand pattern:**  
Daily trends in revenue and quantity were steady, suggesting consistent and predictable consumer behavior, stable customer base and stable ordering pattern, a strength that is ideal for inventory planning and which can be further optimized. This flat and reliable sales trend indicates opportunities for predictive planning, mature market which is ripe for strategic interventions to grow margins rather than just volume.

## 💡 Recommendations

### 💰 Revenue Optimization
- Review pricing strategy for high-volume, low-revenue drugs to improve profit margins
- Consider bundling slow-moving drugs with top performers to increase turnover.

### 🎯 Targeted Marketing
- Focus marketing efforts on top-performing drugs like **Azithromycin, Saxagliptin, Clonazepam, and Sertraline** to maximize ROI.
- Invest in promoting mid-tier drugs with untapped potential.  
- Boost visibility of low-performing drugs through promotions or targeted advertising to improve their sales and demand.

### 🏪 Inventory Adjustment & Management
- Align stock with demand trends to minimize holding costs and avoid shortage of high demand products.  
- Use historical trends for accurate **demand forecasting** and **restocking schedules**.  
- Avoid stockouts of top-selling drugs and improve **supply chain efficiency**.

### 🔁 Underperforming Product Lifecycle Review
- Re-evaluate consistently underperforming drugs and consider strategic repositioning, promotion,  discontinuation, phasing out or repackaging to streamline operations and reduce waste.
- Investigate reasons for low performance of drugs like **Dorzolamide, Lubiprostone** Brimonidine, *Bupropion etc*, considering factors like demand, pricing, or shelf life.
